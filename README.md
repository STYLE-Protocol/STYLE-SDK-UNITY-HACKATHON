# Hackathon Goals
Every Game developer have to integrate his own game with STYLE SDK with at least two functionality:
- Listing NFTS
- Payment(buy NFTs through our smart contract)
- Extra functionality is welcomed too, for example Adding programmable NFTs to make NFTs more to games assets.

Hint: here is full exmaple how to do it [link](https://style-protocol.gitbook.io/sdk/overview/try-sdk/try-sdk-for-unity)

# Hackthon Rules 
- Developer should submit fully functional Game on Unity using open source or his own code integrated as mentioned before 
- The final submission should be on github as private repo add [@enghamzasalem](https://github.com/enghamzasalem/) as collaborator or you fork this repo and create pull request.
- Your submission should include a web page as a demo for your Game with a readme file including the steps of how to buy and use the NFTs in the Game. For example: [demo](https://style-protocol.github.io/STYLE-protocol-SDK-unity-Demo/)
